Gllacy is one of my first projects where I honed my HTML coding skills.

The description of the project: the project consists of 2 pages (main and catalog page), static design (desktop only).

Main page:
1. The project header contains drop-down elements: menu, search form and login form;
2. The slider with switching the background of the page;
3. Product cards that change their state on hover (visual effects and button appearances);
4. The interactive map that stretches depending on the width of the screen;
5. The pop-up - a feedback form;

Catalog page (you can go to the "Catalog" link in the main page menu):
1. The state of the basket with the selected items;
2. Added complex form elements;
3. Product cards that change their state on hover (visual effects and button appearances);

Technical features:
1. Used: HTML, CSS, progressive enhancement, JavaScript;
2. HTML is made taking into account accessibility and pixel perfect concept;
3. Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Safari;
5. JS is used for the slider and interaction with the feedback form;
